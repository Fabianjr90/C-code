# Cpp code

**Pathfinding_Algorithms.cpp** contains four different algorithms for finding the shortest path between two nodes: (1) Breadth-first search, (2) Dijkstra's algorithm, (3) A* algorithm, (4) A* algorithm "alternative path"

**node_forces.cpp** applies repulsive forces between nodes to unravel a graph

**WikiLadder.cpp** finds the shortest distance between two Wikipedia sites. Example: shortest distance between the "Milkshake" and "Gene" Wikipedia sites is: Milkshake-->Carbohydrate-->DNA-->Gene
